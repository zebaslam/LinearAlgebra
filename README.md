# LinearAlgebra

This implements the functionality asscociated with [GA Tech's Linear Algebra Refresher course on Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud953). 

Mainly, this implements functions for: 
1. Vectors
2. Intersections
3. Matrices and State Transformations

I used Python 2.7 to implement this functionality.
